# Chak
## if you can run node.js on a device, you can run CHAK.

### How to use
1. download `node.js` and `npm`.
2. run below command in your terminal
    - ` npm install net`
    - `npm install fs`
    - `npm install os`
3. then run `node server.js` on the server.
4. keep sure devices are under the same Wi-Fi.
5. run `node client.js` on the client devices, congratulation!


### My To-Dev list
- more **splash command** ( with now version you can use `/ban`, `/online` and `/stat` )
- add a **official server** to help people who don't have a server at home
- add **user system**, which means you can having no longer a ip but a name!
- add self-host chat server, a server run right on your computer!

  *(It maybe a little bit of complicated but it'll definitely worth!)*
- add a **server hall** to let people connect the public hall more easily
